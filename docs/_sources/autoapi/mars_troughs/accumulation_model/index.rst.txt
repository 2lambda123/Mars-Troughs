.. py:class:: AccumulationModel(sub_models: Optional[List[Model]] = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`mars_troughs.model.Model`

   Abstract class for computing the amount of ice accumulation.

   .. py:attribute:: prefix
      :annotation: :str = acc_

      All parameters of accumulations models start with 'acc'.

.. py:class:: TimeDependentAccumulationModel(times: numpy.ndarray, variable: numpy.ndarray)

   Bases: :py:obj:`AccumulationModel`

   An accumulation rate model that depends on the time dependent parameter
   (likely solar insolation or obliquity), A(Var(t)).
   A is in m/year. Interpolated splines are created for the parameter as
   a function of time for faster integration.

                 (in years)
   :type times: np.ndarray

          accumulation rates A, in m/year

      center of the high side of the trough. This distance x is a function of
      the accumulation rate A(ins(t)) and the retreat rate of ice R(l(t),t)
      as in dx/dt=(R(l(t),t)+A(ins(t))cos(theta))/sin(theta). Where theta
